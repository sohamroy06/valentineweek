        <h1>Happy Valentine's Day!</h1>
        <p>
            Hey bubu , 
            we know we are very far away now , but our bond remains as strong as ever , this time also shall pass , and i know you miss 
            me and i miss u too but we can do nothing about it . 
            To my one and only love of my life:
        </p>
        <p>
            From Afar, With Endless Love<br>

            From the days of childhood, hand in hand we grew,<br>
            In every memory, there's a piece of you.<br>
            Now miles apart, yet close in heart,<br>
            Our love, unyielding, a timeless art.<br>

            Through books and dreams, you pave your way,<br>
            While I chase mine, both striving each day.<br>
            In the silence of night, beneath the same star,<br>
            I whisper, "I love you," no matter how far.<br>

            Someday soon, this distance will fade,<br>
            In each other's arms, our dreams are made.<br>
            Until then, my heart beats true,<br>
            Happy Valentine's, my love, to you.
